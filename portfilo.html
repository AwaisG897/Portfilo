  <div class="c box1"><h2> c++</h2>
    <p>Certainly! C++ is a powerful and widely used programming language. It was developed as an extension of the C programming language and offers many additional features that make it suitable for a wide range of applications. Here are some basic pieces of information about C++:

      1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): C++ is an object-oriented programming language, which means it supports the concepts of classes and objects. Objects are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior.
      
      2. Compiled Language: C++ is a compiled language, which means that the source code needs to be compiled into machine code before execution.  </p>

  <div class="html box1"><h2> Html</h2>
    <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and structure the content of web pages. It provides a set of elements (tags) that define the structure and layout of a webpage. Here are some basic pieces of information about HTML:

      1. *HTML Document Structure*: An HTML document is structured with a series of nested elements. The root element is `<html>`, and it contains two main sections: `<head>` and `<body>`. The head section includes metadata about the document, such as the title, character encoding, and links to stylesheets and scripts. The body section contains the visible content of the webpage.
      </p>
  </div> -->
  <!-- <div class="css box1"><h2> CSS</h2>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to define the presentation and layout of HTML documents. It allows you to control the appearance of web pages, including fonts, colors, spacing, and positioning. Here are some fundamental points about CSS:

      1. *CSS Syntax*: CSS consists of rulesets that define how HTML elements should be displayed. Each ruleset contains a selector and a set of declarations. The selector targets HTML elements, and the declarations define the styles to be applied. The basic syntax is as follows:
      
      css
      selector {
        property: value;
        /* More properties and values can be added */
      }
      <p>
  </div>

  <div class="c box3"><h2>JS</h2>
    <p>JavaScript (often abbreviated as JS) is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language primarily used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It is an essential component of front-end web development and can also be used on the server-side with frameworks like Node.js. Here are some basic points about JavaScript:

      1. *Client-Side Scripting*: JavaScript is primarily used as a client-side scripting language, meaning it runs on the user's web browser. It enables interaction with the HTML and CSS, making web pages more dynamic and responsive.
      
      2. *Syntax*: JavaScript has a C-style syntax and is relatively easy to learn if you have experience with other programming languages. It uses variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and objects, among other constructs.
      </p>
  </div>
  <div class="html box3"> <h2>Php</h2>
    <p>1. *Server-Side Scripting*: PHP is a server-side scripting language, which means it runs on the web server before the HTML is sent to the user's browser. This is in contrast to client-side languages like JavaScript, which run in the user's browser.
      
      2. *Syntax*: PHP syntax is similar to C-style languages, making it relatively easy for developers with programming experience to learn. PHP code is enclosed within `<?php` and `?>` tags in an HTML file.
      
      3. *Variables and Data Types*: PHP allows you to declare variables without explicitly specifying their data types. It supports common data types such as integers, strings, floats, arrays, and booleans.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="css box3"> <h2>My Sql</h2> 
    <p>MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) widely used for storing and managing data. It is one of the most popular databases for web applications, powering many websites and applications on the internet. Here are some basic pieces of information about MySQL:

      1. *Relational Database Management System (RDBMS):* MySQL is an RDBMS, which means it stores data in tables with rows and columns. It allows you to define relationships between tables and perform complex queries to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data.
      
      2. *Open Source:* MySQL is open-source software, meaning it is freely available for use and modification under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This has contributed to its widespread adoption and continuous development by the community.
